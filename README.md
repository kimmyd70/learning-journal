# What is Growth Mindset?
### Summarized by Kim Damalas, github @kimmyd70
Growth Mindset is a method of turning "I can't" thoughts into motivational "I can" that leads to higher achievement. It is a way of learning that combines positive self-reflection on the part of the student and positive reinforcement, specifically building a supportive learning environment, on the part of the instructor. Using stacked lessons that build on each other and encouraging students to change their inner thoughts of doubt to positivity, teachers can foster a positive attitude toward learning where the student feels safe, valued, and rewarded.  With baby steps, small victories, and self-introspection the student starts to feel more confident and that confidence breeds bigger victories and a willingness to tackle bigger challenges. Socially, Growth Mindset thinking is a belief that intelligence is not set by birth status or physical characteristics.  Rather, every person can learn given the right tools and environment.

Growth Mindset is scientifically supported by studies in **neural plasticity**.  Chiefly, Dr Carol Dweck coined the terms *Growth Mindset* vs *Fixed Mindset* as she explored the neural network growth of children while employing positive, supportive habits for learning.  Dr Dweck found simple changes to thinking and routine change not only the psychology of the student, but the physical makeup of his/her brain.  Essentially, science has proven Growth Mindset builds more efficient brains!

>With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. >These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good >strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.''''

Being a strong Type-A personality and embodying the good and bad traits of a Leo, I am very harsh on myself when it comes to learning something new. I need to remember to be kind to myself as much as I would be to any of my fellow students or student I was teaching who expressed doubt.  There are at least 3 ways I can foster a positive Growth Mindset in myself during my current job as CF Student:

* "I made a mistake" becomes "I'm new at this"
* Remembering that my work will never be perfect and **sleep** is just as important that those last few tweaks to the project
* Setting up a routine to ensure a work-life balance
