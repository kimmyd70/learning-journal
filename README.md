# Growth Mindset
## summarized by Kim Damalas, github @kimmyd70
Growth Mindset is a method of turning "I can't" thoughts into motivational "I can" that leads to higher achievement. Using stacked lessons that build on each other and encouraging students to change their inner thoughts of doubt to positivity.  With baby steps, small victories, and self-introspection the student starts to feel more confident and that confidence breeds bigger victories.
