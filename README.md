# What is Growth Mindset?
### Summarized by Kim Damalas, github @kimmyd70
Growth Mindset is a method of turning "I can't" thoughts into motivational "I can" that leads to higher achievement. It is a way of learning that combines positive self-reflection on the part of the student and positive reinforcement, specifically building a supportive learning environment, on the part of the instructor. Using stacked lessons that build on each other and encouraging students to change their inner thoughts of doubt to positivity, teachers can foster a positive attitude toward learning where the student feels safe, valued, and rewarded.  With baby steps, small victories, and self-introspection the student starts to feel more confident and that confidence breeds bigger victories and a willingness to tackle bigger challenges. 

Growth Mindset is scientifically supported by studies in #neural plasticity#.  Chiefly, Dr Carol Dweck coined the terms "Growth Mindset" vs "Fixed Mindset" as she explored the neural network growth of children when employing positive, supportive habits for learning.  Dr Dweck's findings are summarized nicely on this site https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/ with how simple changes to thinking and routine change not only the psychology of the student, but the physical makeup of his/her brain
''''With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.''''
