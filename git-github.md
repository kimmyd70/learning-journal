### This link is a great source [Git intro](https://www.udemy.com/blog/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#3)
Here are some highlights and takeaways:
*Git began as a distributed version control service (*DVCS*) in 2005
*It's useful to do some initial configuration via the Terminal such as adding name and e-mail to be included in file meta--we did that on Tuesday
*Git has built in help that can be accessed by:
    -git help command
    -git command --help
    -man git-command
