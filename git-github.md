### This link is a great source [Git intro](https://www.udemy.com/blog/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#3)
Here are some highlights and takeaways:
* Git began as a distributed version control service (*DVCS*) in 2005
* It's useful to do some initial configuration via the Terminal such as adding name and e-mail to be included in file meta--we did that on Tuesday
* Git has built in help that can be accessed by:
    - git help command
    - git command --help
    - man git-command
   
 * The first thing we want to do is set up a repository.  We've already done this through GitHub, but you can also do it using Terminal
 
 * You can use the Terminal to clone a repository you've set up on GitHub in order to work on your computer
 > with a repositoryâ€™s URL: `$ git clone https://github.com/test`
