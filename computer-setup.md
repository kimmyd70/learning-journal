Available text editors are native programs already on your computer such as TextEdit or Notepad, 3rd party software such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code or Notepad +++.  You get what you pay for in capability--native programs give little to no help with syntax fill in or finding mistakes

We will be using VS Code in this class.  I just downloaded it from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx)

I'd **LOVE** if I could use dreamweaver to code then copy/paste into GitHub it would be AMAZING, but I guess I'll become familiar with Visual Studio :unamused:

Terminal--oh man!!
Terminal will become an easy way to navigate my computer without using the GUI.  
+ *pwd* tells you where you are  
+ *ls* lists the files in that directory
+ *touch* opens the file
+ *mkdir* makes a directory 
+ *cd <filename>* gets you into the file  
+ *cd ..* gets you out one level
