#How to choose a text editor
 I don’t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. Yes,
some text editing software comes with features that other text editing
software does not. But for the most part, they’re all pretty similar.
I think it all comes down to the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
Can you use the text editor that you love, cherish and swear by to
make a complete web site successfully and to your satisfaction? Yes?
You can? Then fantastic, clearly the text editor you’ve chosen got the
job done. [Article by Older Coder](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)
